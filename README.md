* Transactional web sites with lots of moving parts including
  microservices, diverse storage requirements, analytics, real-time
  bidding and automated buying systems.

* Geospatial computation with Pandas for analysing commercial data. 

* General Python standards and how to apply good practices to get
  better, more maintainable code.

* Better protocols for web frameworks.

* Web site accessability in the sense of the [W3C WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/).

Some articles I've authored:

[Python Coding Guidelines](https://github.com/paul-wolf/python_coding/blob/main/python_guidelines.md)

This is a set of guidelines to make Python code more readable, easier
to maintain and easier to reuse.

[Modern Python Logging](https://medium.com/@paul.wolf/modern-python-logging-9cab0d07a2ed)

This is an opinionated view of how logging should be done for Python applications.

[Djaq: A Different Concept for Django Queries](https://medium.com/@paul.wolf/djaq-a-different-concept-for-django-queries-92667af0fd17)

Djaq - pronounced "Jack" - provides an instant remote API to your
Django models data with a powerful query language. No server-side code
beyond two lines of config is required. You don't write backend
classes, serializers or any other code to be able to immediately get
whatever data you want to the client. And it is blazing fast.

[Modern Django Settings](https://medium.com/@paul.wolf/modern-django-settings-84ecc8bae446)

Some good practices for Django settings for medium to larger projects. 

[A More Practical REST](https://medium.com/@paul.wolf/a-more-practical-rest-e13699ab3b3)

The REST pattern for writing APIs has a lot of traction and is the
basis for many public APIs. It does, however, have some serious
problems. This article proposes some changes to the principles
underlying REST to make it a better convention.
