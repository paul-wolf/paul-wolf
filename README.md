Some articles I've authored:

[Python Coding Guidelines](https://python-coding-guidelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

This is a set of guidelines to make Python code more readable, easier
to maintain and easier to reuse.

[Simple Rules for Class Design](https://dev.to/paulwolf/class-design-in-python-simple-rules-for-managing-complexity-3eka)

A formula that can be applied almost mechanically to simplify class design in
Python, making your code easier to read, change and test.

[Modern Python Logging](https://medium.com/@paul.wolf/modern-python-logging-9cab0d07a2ed)

This is an opinionated view of how logging should be done for Python applications.

[Djaq: A Different Concept for Django Queries](https://medium.com/@paul.wolf/djaq-a-different-concept-for-django-queries-92667af0fd17)

Djaq - pronounced "Jack" - provides an instant remote API to your
Django models data with a powerful query language. No server-side code
beyond two lines of config is required. You don't write backend
classes, serializers or any other code to be able to immediately get
whatever data you want to the client. And it is blazing fast.

[Modern Django Settings](https://medium.com/@paul.wolf/modern-django-settings-84ecc8bae446)

Some good practices for Django settings for medium to larger projects. 

[A More Practical REST](https://medium.com/@paul.wolf/a-more-practical-rest-e13699ab3b3)

The REST pattern for writing APIs has a lot of traction and is the
basis for many public APIs. It does, however, have some serious
problems. This article proposes some changes to the principles
underlying REST to make it a better convention.
